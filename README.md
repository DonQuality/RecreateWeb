#Recreate a Web Site *HomeWork*

In this homework we have to recreate a Web site just using **HTML5** semantic tags and **Aria** roles. Offering more information and better accessibility to the users.

We chose to recreate the Netflix site from the view of someone who is already logged in. The main features were a nav bar with multiple hidden lists, a slideshow of video reccomendations, and finally the lists and lists of movie links.
